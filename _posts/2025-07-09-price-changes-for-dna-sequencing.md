**The Price Changes from 2001, 2011, and 2021 for DNA Sequencing**

Starting in 2001, DNA sequencing would cost $10,000 just to sequence one mega-basepairs of chromosomes. This means that sequencing hundreds and hundreds of mega-basepairs of chromosomes would cost scientists tens of millions of dollars. This was a huge issue as it drastically limited the understanding of DNA and how it truly works. 
However, the advancement of technology up to 2011 allowed for must cheaper ways to sequence DNA. This allowed for the cost
