**The Price Changes from 2001, 2011, and 2021 for DNA Sequencing**

  Starting in 2001, DNA sequencing would cost $10,000 just to sequence one mega-basepairs of chromosomes. This means that sequencing hundreds and hundreds of mega-basepairs of chromosomes would cost scientists tens of millions of dollars. This was a huge issue as it drastically limited the understanding of DNA and how it truly works. 
  However, the advancement of technology up to 2011 allowed for must cheaper ways to sequence DNA. This allowed for the cost to decrease to a whopping $0.10 per mega-basepair. This lowered the total cost from tens of millions of dollars, down to only a few hundred dollars, which is a significant improvement and made DNA research much easier. 
  Following 2011, technology improved even more, and after another decade (2021), the price dropped to only $0.01 per mega-basepair. This allowed for thousands of mega-basepairs of chromosomes to be sequenced with only tens of dollars. 
  I think that these advancements in technology are extremely significant for humanity as it allows for scientists to further understand how DNA is able to structure the human genome.
