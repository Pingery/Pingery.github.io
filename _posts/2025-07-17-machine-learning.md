# Machine Learning

Today I learned about machine learning and it's importance. Data is able to be given the the computer, and the computer is able to make extremely accurate predictions based on the given data. The predictions can be compared to the actual data. This comparison helps summarize the performance that of the classification model what was made. I also learned today about the 4 different branches of machine learning. Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforced learning. 

Here is my Jupyter Notebook for today[(https://github.com/Pingery/Pingery.github.io/blob/main/machineLearning.html)]
