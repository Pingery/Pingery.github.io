# Helix

  Helix, founded by Scott Burke, Justin Kao, and James Lu, is a company that's designed to help huamnity understand DNA. Helix was originally founded on June 15, 2015 with the initial investment being nearly 100 million dollars. Today, the company's revenue could range from $35 million dollars to $180 million dollars. There's an extremely large descrepency because the company hasn't informed the public about this kind of information, which only leaves people guessing how much the true revenue is. 
  Continuing, their goal with DNA is to aid in the understanding of DNA. With more knowledge on DNA, clinics and hospitals can hopefully make curing patients of certain diseases much easier. 
  I personally think that the company is going to be successful in the future as hospitals are only going to want more knowledge on DNA.
